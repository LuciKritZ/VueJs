            if the result function that's being executed here, uses one of the properties that we have used.
            As a result, there is reexcution of the method, which is not a problem for small functions. But, what 
            if there's a large function that takes a lot of time and you don't want it to get executed everytime
            there is a change in the property. That's where computed property comes. -->

            <!-- The computed properties are nothing but Dependent Properties. It also allows us to store properties.
             -->
            
            <!-- VueJs makes it much simpler to model cross property dependecies. -->

            <!-- Both result and output looks same but there's a difference. The output function will not be called
            when there's a change other than properties related to the output function. So, this is how computed
            works. -->

            <!-- Notice that we haven't used parenthesis, that's because every function in a computed will be used
            as a property/object and not a function. -->
            <!-- Result function gets called everytime. But, in the case of computed properties, it does analyze
            the code and it is aware of this. -->

            <!--There's another property called watch. Watch comes to picture when there is a need of a trigger
            after some specific task. Some characteristics of Watch:
                1. Watch can only perform operations on the objects which are present in the data property.
                2. It allows to react to the changes.
                3. Works as a trigger.
                4. Has a callback function whenever a function gets called to react to changes.
                5. We have to store the view instance in a separate variable to access all the methods and data objects.
                6. Able to perform asynchronous tasks.
