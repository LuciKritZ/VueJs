-> Workflow should have a build process which should optimise our code.
-> We need a development server. Why?
    It runs in the browser. It runs in the client but in the end if you visit a page which uses Vue js,
    it needs a server anyway. You'll have to fetch it from some server. And so, we want to test for such
    circumstances. The file protocol used when we run our index.html file doesn't have the same protocols
    of the HTTP protocol. But, we need to access our Vue JS through HTTP and for that, we need a server
    even when it runs on our machine, we need a server that understands HTTP protocol. And hence, we will
    be able to test under more realistic circumstances.
    Also, there are cases when the data doesn't get fetched unless clicked or any event has been performed,
    so at that time, we need to use server.
    We are not going to code the server. We will use lightweight development server. This will also give use
    some additional benefits like auto reloading.

-> Development Workflow:
    When we want to use multiple imports and multiple scripts, and we want to bundle them together, it would
    be very complex while using the normal version i.e, the importing the vue file one. This usually doesn't
    work for medium sized and large sized applications. At that we can use development workflow. It can offer
    us some special features such as
        -> Compile Single File Templates (don't use "template"!)
        -> Case-sensitive Component Selectors
        -> Preprocessors and more...
    We can even create single file templates using development workflow.
    ---- SINGLE FILE TEMPLATES ----
    Single File template are a powerful alternative for using the $el property and inferring a template
    from the DOM or the template property.
    It's basically the template outsourced into a separate file and the workflow we'll be using has a certain
    tool in it which understands the single file templates and is able to combine them. We have been using a set up
    where everything gets compiled in the browser. So now, we will get rid of the compiler and we are shipping the 
    finished code.

    ---- CASE-INSENSITIVE COMPONENT SELECTORS AND PREPROCESSORS ----
    This will also allow us to use case insensitive component selector. And we can apply some preprocessors like
    babel to use ES 6 code or to compile SASS to CSS to compile them. 

    Not only this, it will allow us to shrink the size of the Vue JS code that we shipped to the server. 
    // Side effect: Compiler removed from VueJS package => 30% reduced Package size.

-> Template Compilation:
    VueJS Project Templates
    npm install -g vue-cli

    Different types of templates:
    -> simple: Contains single HTML file and Vue CDN import. (Good for small sized applications.)
    -> webpack-simple: It will recompile the single file templates which allows us to use the ES6 and gives us
        a nice production ready application.
    -> webpack: a big package of testing and other next level features, we can use webpack version. It includes 
        CSS processing and testing.
    -> browserify/ browserify-simple: It can be used but there are again based on the requirements and here, we need
        webpack-simple.
    Note: All the templates support the single file templates except the simple template.
