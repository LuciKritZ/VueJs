    with whatever name you want, doesn't have to be an HTML tag and we can still use it. -->

    <script>
      // We can create a resuable component by making an instance of a different Vue JS and then by
      // declaring it in the HTML code. It has some limitations which we will see later on.
      // To create a new component, we can do it by:
      // Vue.component('hello', {
      //   template: '<h1>Hello!</h1>'
      // });

      var data = {
        title: 'The VueJS Instance',
        showParagraph: false
      }

      var vm1 = new Vue({
      // el: '#app1',
      // Here we are removing the $el property cause there may come a time where everything is decided except
      // when and where in the division will it take place. In that case, you can just remove the el property and
      // define it somewhere in the code when needed. For example,
      data: data,
      methods: {
        show: function() {
          this.showParagraph = true;
          this.updateTitle('The VueJS Instance (Updated)');
          this.$refs.myButton.innerText="Changed by $ref";
          this.$refs.heading.innerText = "Changed heading by $ref"
        },
        updateTitle: function(title) {
          this.title = title;
        }
      },
      computed: {
        lowercaseTitle: function() {
          return this.title.toLowerCase();
        }
      },
      watch: {
        title: function(value) {
          alert('Title changed, new value: ' + value);
        }
      }
    });

    // And here we can give the $el property using the $mount() method or function. Here, we can give a mount property
    // to load it for div1. In arguments, pass the id of the div or the template you want to control.

    vm1.$mount('#app1')

    // We can change the properties of an instance outside the function by declaring the variables of an instance.
    // We generally name the instances vm i.e. vue model
    // 

    // Changing the title outside of the instances.
    // setTimeout(function(){
    //   vm1.title = 'Changed by the title ';
    // },3000);

    console.log(vm1.$data.title);

    if(vm1.$data === data){
      console.log("Matched!")
    }

    console.log(vm1.$refs)

    var vm2 = new Vue({
      el: '#app2',
      data: {
        title: 'Instance 2 Title'
      },
      methods:{
        onChange: function(){
          vm1.title = 'Changed';
          // You can change or access the properties of one instance in another instance.
        }
      }
    });

    // Here, we will control the app3 div element by Vue JS
    var vm3 = new Vue({
      // We can use template when we want to want to define our own HTML elements controlled by the Vue JS.
      // We can not write multi line code here and this is one of the limitation of this.
      template: '<h1>This is controlled by Vue JS.</h1>'
    });

    // We will mount the new vm3 using $mount function.
    // vm3.$mount('#app3');

    // The other way to mount it, is by using the Vanilla JS.
    // At first, we can just mount the new instance, so that it gets rendered.
    vm3.$mount();
    // And then we can do it by Vanilla JS by appendChild to append $el property to our instance.
    document.getElementById('app3').appendChild(vm3.$el);

    // This is the pretty advanced stuff and we don't use it normally as Vue JS do it for us pretty easily.
    // This is just for the knowledge. There are a lot of limitations to using the template separately.

<!-- $el: El refers to the element or the instance that relates to the HTML template or div tag. -->
<!-- $data: It refers to the data tag in the elements and it can be accessed by $data in the scripting. -->
<!-- It is okay to combine both Vanilla JS and Vue JS, but the only thing you have to kepe in mind is that
you shouldn't perform or control the HTML with both the Vue Js and Vanilla Js as they can react separately
and then it may lead to poor reactivity of the application. -->

<!-- We can use refs to interact with the HTML, but one thing to keep in mind is that it just overwrites the code
and doesn't save it. So, if you reload the page, the changes will not be updated, as there's nothing to do with the 
state and it's data. -->

<!-- So this is the version of the Vue where there is no compiler. There's a different version of Vue too, 
which includes the prebuilt compiler and it can reduce our efforts too. -->


<!-- How Vue JS updates the DOM?
Vue JS creates a virtual DOM where it loads all the compiled code of a Vue instance and the real DOPM and whenever there
is a change in the state or the data, the Virtaul DOM is compared with the data and gets updated and
then it compares itself with the original DOM and updates it as well.
The change detection happens with the help of the Watchers. This makes Vue JS with very performent and very fast. -->

<!-- Understanding the Vue JS Instance Lifecycle:
  1. new Vue(): When the Vue instance is declared.
  2. beforeCreated(): This life cycle method gets called before the instance is created.
  3. Inititalise the Data and Events: Initialisation of the data and events is done here. 
  4. created(): The created() life cycle method gets called after the instance is created.
  5. Compile template or $el's template: The template is compiled with all the data and events given to the instance.
  6. beforeMount(): beforeMount() lifecycle method gets called whenever the component is about to get mounted.
  7. Mounted to DOM: Then the component gets mounted in the DOM.
  ----- IF THE DATA GETS UPDATED -----
  8. Data Changed: When the data gets changed, another life cycle method is called which is,
  9. beforeUpdate(): This gets called when the data is about to get changed. 
  10. Re-render DOM: The DOM gets re-rendered after the data has been changed.
  11. updated(): The data that has been updated can be seen in the DOM.
  12. Mounted to DOM: Then the component again gets mounted to the DOM.

  ----- AT THE TIME OF DELETION ----- 
  13. beforeDestroy(): This life cycle method gets called right before the deletion of the instance or the component.
  14. DESTROYED: Now, the component gets destroyed.
  15. destroyed(): This life cycle method gets called after the successful deletion of the instance or the component.
