<!-- Understanding the Vue JS Instance Lifecycle:
  1. new Vue(): When the Vue instance is declared.
  2. beforeCreated(): This life cycle method gets called before the instance is created.
  3. Inititalise the Data and Events: Initialisation of the data and events is done here. 
  4. created(): The created() life cycle method gets called after the instance is created.
  5. Compile template or $el's template: The template is compiled with all the data and events given to the instance.
  6. beforeMount(): beforeMount() lifecycle method gets called whenever the component is about to get mounted.
  7. Mounted to DOM: Then the component gets mounted in the DOM.
  ----- IF THE DATA GETS UPDATED -----
  8. Data Changed: When the data gets changed, another life cycle method is called which is,
  9. beforeUpdate(): This gets called when the data is about to get changed. 
  10. Re-render DOM: The DOM gets re-rendered after the data has been changed.
  11. updated(): The data that has been updated can be seen in the DOM.
  12. Mounted to DOM: Then the component again gets mounted to the DOM.

  ----- AT THE TIME OF DELETION ----- 
  13. beforeDestroy(): This life cycle method gets called right before the deletion of the instance or the component.
  14. DESTROYED: Now, the component gets destroyed.
  15. destroyed(): This life cycle method gets called after the successful deletion of the instance or the component.

<!-- So this is how Vue JS works behind the scenes and how the data gets updated. -->
